# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 2. Pseudocode
# => Convert string to array
# => Split into sub-arrays with a space as a delimiter
# => Reverse each sub-array
# => Join sub-arrays
# => Convert to string


# 3. Initial Solution
 
 def reverse_words(sentence)
 	sentence.reverse
 end



# 4. Refactored Solution






# 1. DRIVER TESTS/ASSERT STATEMENTS GO BELOW THIS LINE

puts reverse_words("Hello there people")




# 5. Reflection
