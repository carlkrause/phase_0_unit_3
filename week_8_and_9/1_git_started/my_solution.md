## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
"git add #filename" tells Git to start tracking a file--it stages it for further action.

#### branch
"git branch #nameofbranch" tells Git to create a new branch for our feature or project

#### checkout
"git checkout #nameofbranch" tells Git to switch branches, including switching back to the master

#### clone
"git clone #url" clones a remote repository to the local environment

#### commit
"git commit -m #'message'" takes tracked files in a particular branch and takes a "snapshot" of them in their current state

#### fetch
"git fetch" goes to the remote repository, syncs, but does not merge it with the local version

#### log
"git log" provides a summary of recent changes to the branch

#### merge
"git merge #branchname" merges the specified branch with the current branch

#### pull
"git pull" fetches and syncs the local repository with the remote repository

#### push
"git push" updates the origin/master to be at the same state as the local repository

#### reset
"git reset" reverts the branch to an earlier commit

#### rm
"git rm" removes the file or "-r" folder

#### status
"git status" shows which files are tracked or untracked
