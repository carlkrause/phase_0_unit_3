### Reflection

I enjoyed the format of this challenge. SQL is straightforward--experience with Excel and stats programs definitely make it easier. It's very intuitive and flexible, which I appreciate. 

I'm interested to see how this integrates with what we've learned in other units. So far we've been working with very simple programs in Ruby and I'm excited to start using some real-world data to animate our programs.
